Title: Variance-Covariance Matrices and Standard Errors
Author: Michael Chirico
Maintainer: Michael Chirico <MichaelChirico4@gmail.com>
Depends: R (>= 3.4.0)
Description: Methods for faster extraction (about 5x faster in a few test cases) of variance-covariance matrices and standard errors from models. Methods in the 'stats' package tend to rely on the summary method, which may waste time computing other summary statistics which are summarily ignored.
